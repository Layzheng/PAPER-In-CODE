In its first year, the Brickyard 400 became NASCAR\u0027s most-attended event, drawing an estimated crowd of more than 250,000 spectators in 1994. It also pays NASCAR\u0027s second-highest purse.\nThe term \"Brickyard\" is in reference to the nickname historically used for the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The course was paved in brick in 1909, and a one-yard strip of brick remains exposed at the start/finish line. From 2005–2009, the race was known as the Allstate 400 at the Brickyard, under a naming rights arrangement with Allstate Insurance. In 2011, Big Machine Records became the presenting sponsor.

Indianapolis Motor Speedway, located in Speedway, Indiana in the United States, is the home of the Indianapolis 500-Mile Race and the Brickyard 400.\nIt has existed since 1909, and is the original Speedway, the first racing facility so named. With a permanent seating capacity for an estimated 257,325 people, it is the highest-capacity stadium-type facility in the world.\nConsidered relatively flat by American standards, the track is a two-and-a-half-mile, nearly rectangular oval with dimensions that have remained essentially unchanged since its inception: four 1/4-mile turns, two 5/8-mile long straightaways between the fourth and first turns and the second and third turns, and two 1/8-mile short straightaways, termed \"short chutes,\" between the first and second, and third and fourth turns.\nA modern infield road course was constructed between 1998 and 2000, incorporating the western and southern portions of the oval to create a 2.605-mile track. In 2008, the road course was modified to replace the southwest turn with an additional infield section, for motorcycle use, resulting in a 2.621-mile course. Altogether, the current grounds have expanded from an original 320 acres on which the Speedway was first built to cover an area of over 559 acres. Placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987, it currently remains the only such landmark to be affiliated with automotive racing

The event, when first held in 1994, marked the first race other than the Indianapolis 500 to be held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway since 1916. In its first year, the Brickyard 400 became NASCAR\u0027s most-attended event, drawing an estimated crowd of more than 250,000 spectators in 1994. It also pays NASCAR\u0027s second-highest purse.\nThe term \"Brickyard\" is in reference to the nickname historically used for the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The course was paved in brick in 1909, and a one-yard strip of brick remains exposed at the start/finish line. From 2005–2009, the race was known as the Allstate 400 at the Brickyard, under a naming rights arrangement with Allstate Insurance. In 2011, Big Machine Records became the presenting sponsor. For 2012, Crown Royal signed a multi-year contract to be the title sponsor of the event.

Indianapolis Motor Speedway, located in Speedway, Indiana in the United States, is the home of the Indianapolis 500-Mile Race and the Brickyard 400.\nIt has existed since 1909, and is the original Speedway, the first racing facility so named. With a permanent seating capacity for an estimated 257,325 people, it is the highest-capacity stadium-type facility in the world.\nConsidered relatively flat by American standards, the track is a two-and-a-half-mile, nearly rectangular oval with dimensions that have remained essentially unchanged since its inception: four 1/4-mile turns, two 5/8-mile long straightaways between the fourth and first turns and the second and third turns, and two 1/8-mile short straightaways, termed \"short chutes,\" between the first and second, and third and fourth turns.\nA modern infield road course was constructed between 1998 and 2000, incorporating the western and southern portions of the oval to create a 2.605-mile track. In 2008, the road course was modified to replace the southwest turn with an additional infield section, for motorcycle use, resulting in a 2.621-mile course. Altogether, the current grounds have expanded from an original 320 acres on which the Speedway was first built to cover an area of over 559 acres. Placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987, it currently remains the only such landmark to be affiliated with automotive racing

The son of John or of Jonah or Jona, he was from the village of Bethsaida in the province of Galilee or Gaulanitis. His brother Andrew was also an apostle. Peter is venerated in multiple churches and is regarded as the Catholic Church\u0027s first pope. He is credited with establishing the church in Antioch and presiding for seven years as the leader of that city\u0027s Christian community. Either in person or via epistle, his words reached Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia Minor and Bithynia where they were received by scattered communities of believers: Jews, Hebrew Christians and Gentiles.

The villagers ostracize Naruto because of the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox—a malevolent creature that attacked Konohagakure—sealed in his body. To be recognized, he aspires to become the village\u0027s leader, the Hokage. His cheerful and boisterous personality lets him befriend other Konohagakure ninja, as well as ninja from other villages. Naruto appears in the series\u0027 films and in other media related to the franchise, including video games and original video animations.\nWhen creating Naruto in the initial part of the series, Kishimoto kept the character \"simple and stupid\", while giving him many attributes of an ideal hero. Kishimoto added a harsh past to give him a side of darkness. Many times he has revised naruto\u0027s image, providing the character with different clothes to appeal to Western audiences and make him easier to illustrate. Kishimoto changed his design for Part II of the storyline, which starts two-and-a-half years after Part I.

Gekitou Ninja Taisen!, is a series of 3D cel-shaded fighting games based on the popular manga and anime series Naruto by Masashi Kishimoto. They are developed by Eighting and published by D3 Publisher and Tomy. Various installments of the series have appeared on both Nintendo\u0027s GameCube and Wii. Four games are available for the GameCube and five for the Wii. Naruto: Clash of Ninja 1, 2, Revolution, Revolution 2 and Revolution 3 are available in the US. Naruto: Clash of Ninja 2 and Revolution are available in PAL regions. Naruto: Clash of Ninja Revolution II was released in Europe on February 13, 2009. All installments, excluding the Revolution series, have been released in Japan.\nEach installment of the series has had numerous methods of play with varying types of modes. New games have introduced additional modes that generally appear in subsequent games. The player directly controls a character taken from the Naruto series, and uses their unique abilities to battle and defeat an opponent. New games in the series include more of the Naruto plotline in a \"story mode,\" and it generally stays true to the source material. As a result, the character selection increases with each installment due to the inclusion of more of the Naruto plotline. With the newer games incorporating Naruto: Shippūden, the second part of the Naruto series, many of the characters have been substantially redesigned, and the selection correspondingly limited. Reactions to early installments were mixed, while later titles have been received more positively, with many praising the simple and easy-to-learn fighting system, while others lambasting the fighting system, and the lack of significant unlockable content."]},{"graph":[{"entityIndex":2,"relationLeft":"common.topic.article.1","relationRight":"common.topic.article.2"}],"denotation":["http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.02vr0cp"]},{"graph":[{"entityIndex":2,"relationLeft":"common.topic.notable_types.1","relationRight":"common.topic.notable_types.2"}],"denotation":["Video Game Series"]},{"graph":[{"entityIndex":2,"relationLeft":"type.object.type.1","relationRight":"type.object.type.2"}],"denotation":["Topic","Video Game Series"]}]},{"function":"none","qid":257000200,"answerF1":["Shueisha"],"entities":[{"index":2,"end":2,"name":"Naruto Shippūden","entity":"m.0b4cxjq","start":2,"score":32.629989491644707,"phrase":"naruto"}],"words":[{"word":"who","pos":"PRON","lemma":"who"},{"word":"published","pos":"VERB","lemma":"publish"},{"word":"naruto","pos":"PROPN","lemma":"Naruto"},{"word":"?","pos":"PUNCT","sentEnd":true,"lemma":"?"}],"goldMids":["m.01hryy"],"id":257000200,"graphs":[{"graph":[{"entityIndex":2,"relationLeft":"base.animemanga.anime_manga_character.anime_appearances.2","relationRight":"base.animemanga.anime_manga_character.anime_appearances.1"}],"denotation":["Naruto Uzumaki","Sakura Haruno","Danzo Shimura","Kushina Uzumaki","Kakashi Hatake"]},{"graph":[{"entityIndex":2,"relationLeft":"common.webpage.topic","relationLeftInverse":"common.topic.webpage","relationRight":"common.webpage.in_index","relationRightInverse":"common.annotation_index.annotations"}],"denotation":["Blissful Celebrities","Blissful Master Index"]},{"graph":[{"entityIndex":2,"relationLeft":"tv.tv_genre.programs.2","relationRight":"tv.tv_genre.programs.1"}],"denotation":["Comedy","Comedy film","Action/Adventure","Action film","Adventure film","Fantasy","Animation","Anime","Action"]},{"graph":[{"entityIndex":2,"relationLeft":"base.animemanga.anime_studio.anime_titles.2","relationRight":"base.animemanga.anime_studio.anime_titles.1"}],"denotation":["Pierrot"]},{"graph":[{"entityIndex":2,"relationLeft":"tv.tv_soundtrack.tv_program.2","relationRight":"tv.tv_soundtrack.tv_program.1"}],"denotation":["Naruto Shippuuden Original Soundtrack 2"]},{"graph":[{"entityIndex":2,"relationLeft":"common.topic.image.1","relationRight":"common.topic.image.2"}],"denotation":["Naruto Shippuden Poster","nar.jpg"]},{"graph":[{"entityIndex":2,"relationLeft":"tv.tv_program.number_of_episodes.1","relationRight":"tv.tv_program.number_of_episodes.2"}],"denotation":["319"]},{"graph":[{"entityIndex":2,"relationLeft":"dataworld.gardening_hint.last_referenced_by.2","relationRight":"dataworld.gardening_hint.last_referenced_by.1"}],"denotation":["http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.0qvsy6s"]},{"graph":[{"entityIndex":2,"relationLeft":"tv.tv_series_episode.series.2","relationRight":"tv.tv_series_episode.series.1"}],"denotation":["Hidden Jade - With a Name...","The White Zetsu\u0027s Trap","The Target Appears","Kakashi, My Eternal Rival","A Message from the Heart","Meeting the Six Paths of Pain","The Brilliant Military Advisor of the Hidden Leaf","Power - Episode 6","Land Ahoy!

Naruto Strait, a channel between Naruto in Tokushima and Awaji Island in Hyōgo, Japan.\nThe strait between Naruto and Awaji island has a width of about 1.3 km. The strait is one of the connections between the Pacific Ocean and the Inland Sea, a body of water separating Honshū and Shikoku, two of the main islands of Japan. The tide moves large amounts of water into the Inland Sea twice per day, and also removes large amounts of water twice a day. With a range of up to 1.7 m, the tide creates a difference in the water level of up to 1.5 m between the Inland Sea and the Pacific. Due to the narrowness of the strait, the water rushes through the Naruto channel at a speed of about 13–15 km/h four times per day, twice flowing in and twice flowing out. During a spring tide, the speed of the water may reach 20 km/h, creating vortices up to 20 m in diameter.\nThe current in the strait is the fastest in Japan and the fourth fastest in the world after the Saltstraumen outside Bodø in Norway, which reaches speeds of 37 km/h, the Moskenstraumen off the Lofoten islands in Norway, which reaches speeds of 27.8 km/h; and the Old Sow whirlpool in New Brunswick, Canada, which has been measured with a speed of up to 27.6 km/h."]},{"graph":[{"entityIndex":2,"relationLeft":"common.topic.article.1","relationRight":"common.topic.article.2"}],"denotation":["http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.032y30"]},{"graph":[{"entityIndex":2,"relationLeft":"common.topic.notable_types.1","relationRight":"common.topic.notable_types.2"}],"denotation":["Location"]},{"graph":[{"entityIndex":2,"relationLeft":"type.object.type.1","relationRight":"type.object.type.2"}],"denotation":["Topic","Location"]}]},{"function":"none","qid":257000200,"answerF1":["Shueisha"],"entities":[{"index":2,"end":2,"name":"Naruto Shippuden the Movie: Bonds","entity":"m.03gyvwg","start":2,"score":31.693853858482388,"phrase":"naruto"}],"words":[{"word":"who","pos":"PRON","lemma":"who"},{"word":"published","pos":"VERB","lemma":"publish"},{"word":"naruto","pos":"PROPN","lemma":"Naruto"},{"word":"?","pos":"PUNCT","sentEnd":true,"lemma":"?"}],"goldMids":["m.01hryy"],"id":257000200,"graphs":[{"graph":[{"entityIndex":2,"relationLeft":"film.film.initial_release_date.1","relationRight":"film.film.initial_release_date.2"}],"denotation":["2008"]},{"graph":[{"entityIndex":2,"relationLeft":"film.film.directed_by.1","relationRight":"film.film.directed_by.2"}],"denotation":["Hajime Kamegaki"]},{"graph":[{"entityIndex":2,"relationLeft":"film.film_film_distributor_relationship.film","relationLeftInverse":"film.film.distributors","relationRight":"film.film_film_distributor_relationship.distributor","relationRightInverse":"film.film_distributor.films_distributed"}],"denotation":["Toho Co., Ltd."]},{"graph":[{"entityIndex":2,"relationLeft":"film.performance.film","relationLeftInverse":"film.film.starring","relationRight":"film.performance.special_performance_type","relationRightInverse":"film.special_film_performance_type.film_performance_type"}],"denotation":["Voice acting in Japan"]},{"graph":[{"entityIndex":2,"relationLeft":"dataworld.gardening_hint.last_referenced_by.2","relationRight":"dataworld.gardening_hint.last_referenced_by.1"}],"denotation":["http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.0hgjfcx"]},{"graph":[{"entityIndex":2,"relationLeft":"film.film.genre.1","relationRight":"film.film.genre.2"}],"denotation":["Action film","Animation","Anime","Japanese Movies"]},{"graph":[{"entityIndex":2,"relationLeft":"film.film.sequel.1","relationRight":"film.film.sequel.2"}],"denotation":["Naruto Shippuden the Movie: The Will of Fire","Naruto Shippuden the Movie: The Lost Tower"]},{"graph":[{"entityIndex":2,"relationLeft":"film.performance.film","relationLeftInverse":"film.film.starring","relationRight":"film.performance.actor","relationRightInverse":"film.actor.film"}],"denotation":["Masako Katsuki","Showtaro Morikubo","Kazuhiko Inoue","Nobutoshi Canna","Rikiya Koyama","Kumai Motoko","Chie Nakamura","Kentaro Ito","Keiko Nemoto","Noriaki Sugiyama","Unshō Ishizuka","Hōchū Ōtsuka","Nana Mizuki","Kujira","Shinji Kawada","Kōichi Tōchika","Satoshi Hino","Junko Takeuchi"]},{"graph":[{"entityIndex":2,"relationLeft":"common.topic.alias.1","relationRight":"common.topic.alias.2"}],"denotation":["Gekijô ban Naruto: Shippûden - Kizuna","Naruto Shippuden: Bonds","Naruto Shippūden: Kizuna"]},{"graph":[{"entityIndex":2,"relationLeft":"film.film.language.1","relationRight":"film.film.language.2"}],"denotation":["Japanese Language"]},{"graph":[{"entityIndex":2,"relationLeft":"film.film_cut.film","relationLeftInverse":"film.film.runtime","relationRight":"film.film_cut.runtime"}],"denotation":["90","93"]},{"graph":[{"entityIndex":2,"relationLeft":"common.topic.description.1","relationRight":"common.topic.description.2"}],"denotation":["Naruto Shippuden the Movie: Bonds is the fifth overall Naruto film, and is the second Naruto: Shippūden film.

character in the anime and manga franchise Naruto, created by Masashi Kishimoto. The central protagonist and title character of the series, he is a young teenage ninja from the fictional village of Konohagakure. The villagers ostracize Naruto because of the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox—a malevolent creature that attacked Konohagakure—sealed in his body. To be recognized, he aspires to become the village\u0027s leader, the Hokage. His cheerful and boisterous personality lets him befriend other Konohagakure ninja, as well as ninja from other villages. Naruto appears in the series\u0027 films and in other media related to the franchise, including video games and original video animations.\nWhen creating Naruto in the initial part of the series, Kishimoto kept the character \"simple and stupid\", while giving him many attributes of an ideal hero. Kishimoto added a harsh past to give him a side of darkness. Many times he has revised naruto\u0027s image, providing the character with different clothes to appeal to Western audiences and make him easier to illustrate. Kishimoto changed his design for Part II of the storyline, which starts two-and-a-half years after Part I.

They are developed by Eighting and published by D3 Publisher and Tomy. Various installments of the series have appeared on both Nintendo\u0027s GameCube and Wii. Four games are available for the GameCube and five for the Wii. Naruto: Clash of Ninja 1, 2, Revolution, Revolution 2 and Revolution 3 are available in the US. Naruto: Clash of Ninja 2 and Revolution are available in PAL regions. Naruto: Clash of Ninja Revolution II was released in Europe on February 13, 2009. All installments, excluding the Revolution series, have been released in Japan.\nEach installment of the series has had numerous methods of play with varying types of modes. New games have introduced additional modes that generally appear in subsequent games. The player directly controls a character taken from the Naruto series, and uses their unique abilities to battle and defeat an opponent. New games in the series include more of the Naruto plotline in a \"story mode,\" and it generally stays true to the source material. As a result, the character selection increases with each installment due to the inclusion of more of the Naruto plotline. With the newer games incorporating Naruto: Shippūden, the second part of the Naruto series, many of the characters have been substantially redesigned, and the selection correspondingly limited. Reactions to early installments were mixed, while later titles have been received more positively, with many praising the simple and easy-to-learn fighting system, while others lambasting the fighting system, and the lack of significant unlockable content."]},{"graph":[{"entityIndex":0,"relationLeft":"type.object.name.1","relationRight":"type.object.name.2"}],"denotation":["Naruto: Clash of Ninja"]},{"graph":[{"entityIndex":0,"relationLeft":"common.topic.article.1","relationRight":"common.topic.article.2"}],"denotation":["http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.02vr0cp"]},{"graph":[{"entityIndex":0,"relationLeft":"common.topic.notable_types.1","relationRight":"common.topic.notable_types.2"}],"denotation":["Video Game Series"]},{"graph":[{"entityIndex":0,"relationLeft":"type.object.type.1","relationRight":"type.object.type.2"}],"denotation":["Topic","Video Game Series"]}]},{"function":"none","qid":257000000,"answerF1":["Shueisha"],"entities":[{"index":0,"end":0,"name":"Naruto Shippūden","entity":"m.0b4cxjq","start":0,"score":33.854197845346128,"phrase":"naruto"}],"words":[{"word":"naruto","pos":"PROPN","lemma":"Naruto"},{"word":"is","pos":"AUX","lemma":"be"},{"word":"published","pos":"VERB","lemma":"publish"},{"word":"by","pos":"ADP","lemma":"by"},{"word":"which","pos":"DET","lemma":"which"},{"word":"company","pos":"NOUN","lemma":"company"},{"word":"?","pos":"PUNCT","sentEnd":true,"lemma":"?"}],"goldMids":["m.01hryy"],"id":257000000,"graphs":[{"graph":[{"entityIndex":0,"relationLeft":"common.webpage.topic","relationLeftInverse":"common.topic.webpage","relationRight":"common.webpage.category","relationRightInverse":"common.annotation_category.annotations"}],"denotation":["Curated Topic"]},{"graph":[{"entityIndex":0,"relationLeft":"tv.tv_program.languages.1","relationRight":"tv.tv_program.languages.2"}],"denotation":["Japanese Language"]},{"graph":[{"entityIndex":0,"relationLeft":"base.schemastaging.tv_star_dubbing_performance.program","relationLeftInverse":"base.schemastaging.tv_program_extra.regular_dubbing_performances","relationRight":"base.schemastaging.tv_star_dubbing_performance.actor","relationRightInverse":"base.schemastaging.tv_actor_extra.regular_dubbing_performances"}],"denotation":["David Lodge","Michelle Ruff","Fred Tatasciore","Kirk Thornton","Tom Gibis","Mary Elizabeth McGlynn","Stephanie Sheh","Doug Erholtz","Debi Mae West","Michael Lindsay","Matthew Mercer","Kari Wahlgren","Henry Dittman","Danielle Judovits","Wally Wingert","Benjamin Diskin","Travis Willingham","Steve Kramer","Beau Billingslea","Dave Wittenberg","Grant George","Steven Blum","Laura Bailey","Tara Platt","J.

The strait is one of the connections between the Pacific Ocean and the Inland Sea, a body of water separating Honshū and Shikoku, two of the main islands of Japan. The tide moves large amounts of water into the Inland Sea twice per day, and also removes large amounts of water twice a day. With a range of up to 1.7 m, the tide creates a difference in the water level of up to 1.5 m between the Inland Sea and the Pacific. Due to the narrowness of the strait, the water rushes through the Naruto channel at a speed of about 13–15 km/h four times per day, twice flowing in and twice flowing out. During a spring tide, the speed of the water may reach 20 km/h, creating vortices up to 20 m in diameter.\nThe current in the strait is the fastest in Japan and the fourth fastest in the world after the Saltstraumen outside Bodø in Norway, which reaches speeds of 37 km/h, the Moskenstraumen off the Lofoten islands in Norway, which reaches speeds of 27.8 km/h; and the Old Sow whirlpool in New Brunswick, Canada, which has been measured with a speed of up to 27.6 km/h."]},{"graph":[{"entityIndex":0,"relationLeft":"type.object.name.1","relationRight":"type.object.name.2"}],"denotation":["Naruto
